# SEAstainability

This is the frontend for SEAstainability, an app built to show sustainable seafood choices.

This app is fully deployed at:
* https://mod3seafood.firebaseapp.com/
* https://mod3seafood.herokuapp.com/fish

App functionality:

* Filter through the sustainable seafood choices on the left by typing in a fish name.
* View fish that are best farmed or caught wild.
* Filter through the seafood list by clicking on a region on the map (SVG).
* Sign-up/login to view seafood choices in your area and add seafood choices to your profile.
* Click on the Dory icon to learn more about protecting our oceans.
